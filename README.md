## redbean's memory

- memory belong to one connection(one thread)

global scope is "persistant" time that you don't 

fill it from thread cuz memory is accounted to 

thread and it is garbage collected even if used...

- all function hooks shares entire definitions

## Why it shows no activity...

Really I can't develop program in such way... the same memory initialised at each turn... Is kind of too much for me...

I understand it's an exploitation to perform something... but it's not ideal nor clever nor economic...

It's from the order/lvl of a young animal harassing a lil one with a wood stick.

it's just a toy. It's a cool one when you are not that regarding like me. :D

## My HTTP RFC?

2xx - All good

3xx - Somethings could be better

4xx - You did something wrong

5xx - Server did something wrong

## Q/A

- What's R&amp;D?

scraping to end with something else a chimera.
